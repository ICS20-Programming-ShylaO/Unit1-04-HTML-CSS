    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Animals are by far one of the most interesting parts of our wonderful world. With animals, we have broadened our horizons in various studies, such as biology, anthropology, chemistry, and so on. In my opinion, one of the most intriguing parts of animals is their colours and how they got them. You might think there is not much to say, but I have one specific animal in mind: tigers. Interested? So am I.</p>
    <h2>Eye of the Prey</h2>
    <p>To start, it is vital to think of the optics of the prey. Animals can see different colours. For example, humans are trichromatic, so we can see red, green, and blue. However, the prey of the tiger (deer and boar) are dichromatic: they can only see green and blue. So, when they see any variation of red, they usually see green, or sometimes a blue-ish green. Tigers grow orange fur because orange is a variation of red, so when they see a tiger, they see green (with an ominous pair of eyes). This is super helpful to tigers, as the habitats they reside in are typically jungles and savannah grasslands, sometimes even mangrove swamps, meaning lots of green and successful stalking for the majestic cat. The question is: Why can't the tigers just grow green fur?</p>

    <h2>The Absence of Green Fur</h2>
    <p>To answer that question, I want you to try to think of a mammal that has green fur. Sloths do not count because it is the algae growing on their brown fur that makes them appear to be green. As you can probably tell, there are no known animals with green fur. This is because mammals have no pigment that produces green in their hair (fur). To solve this problem, tigers grow orange fur because, as we've already established, the tiger's prey see orange as green.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So there you have it. The mystery of the orange fur has been solved, but not in great detail. I am no expert, but I do have a great source explaining this same subject of optics and pigmentation.<br> Here it is: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/why-are-tigers-orange" target="_blank">Live Science</a></p>
